# git-workshop

*Created by Chris Grandin, February 2014*

git-workshop is a repository for learning how to use git version control.
Also included are examples for using *Latex* and the R package *knitr* to apply version control to documents
which are to be edited by more than one person, working collaboratively.


The purpose is to introduce git version control to new users and supply some
useful tools for working with git.

To make everything in this repository work correctly, you will need to <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">sign up for GitHub</a>
and install the following things on your computer. If you have older versions of GitHub or MikTex installed, remove them and start fresh.
GitHub *requires* Microsoft .NET 4.5.1 as of February 2014.

1. If you have a .NET version less than 4.5 ([Check version](https://github.com/downloads/shanselman/SmallestDotNet/CheckForDotNet45.exe "Which .NET version is on my machine?")), then upgrade it: <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=310158" target="_blank">Microsoft .NET 4.5.1</a>.
2. <a href="http://windows.github.com" target="_blank">GitHub for Windows</a>
3. <a href="http://mirrors.ctan.org/systems/win32/miktex/setup/basic-miktex-2.9.5105-x64.exe" target="_blank">Miktex typesetting software</a>
4. The knitr package for R - install.packages("knitr")

Once you have installed GitHub for Windows, go to my [git-workshop](https://github.com/cgrandin/git-workshop "https://github.com/cgrandin/git-workshop")
, make sure you are signed in, and **Fork** the project (button on the top right). This will create a copy of the repository on your GitHub site.

Open the GitHub Application. Choose Tools->Options and under *configure git*, fill in your name, the email address you used for signing up to GitHub,
and change your *default storage directory* to something simple that you will be able to find later. I recommend **c:\github**. Make sure that for
*default shell*, *PowerShell* is checked. *pull behavior* should have *use rebase for pulls* checked. Click *Update* and close the application.
**This is a one-time step and you will not need to do it again unless you want to sign in with a different user name.**

Open the Git Shell, (not the GitHub application). The shortcut should be
**C:\Users\your-computer-user-name\AppData\Local\GitHub\GitHub.appref-ms --open-shell**

Note your starting directory, this is where your files will be. It should be the same as the one you entered into the GitHub application in the steps above.

Type the following to clone your repository onto your local machine:

      git clone https://github.com/your-git-user-name/git-workshop
